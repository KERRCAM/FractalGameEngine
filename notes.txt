TODO PLAN:
put look controls on mouse movement

Tue:
Render order of enemy is a bit messed up -> needs to be inserted between wall renders

have multiple enemies -> put rendering in loop -> sort by dist to player
if they are x dist from pl then path to them
limit pathing to x iters to stop overcomp and also stop at x iters from player for certain enemy types
melee player and enemy just make it so if in proximity and attack then does damage
shooting -> if player is looking at enemy withing x dist and shoots then dmg
enemy shooting -> probs not possible -> maybe show small squares moving out for x seconds then kill them -> same render as enemies (kinda doable actually)
if enemy dies, add score to player
let enemies spawn periodically at set points -> reduces spawn timer as the game goes on -> every minute maybe (2pm then 4pm then 6pm then 10pm then 14pm then 20pm (probably wont make it anything like that far?))
player dies, end game, show final score, let them play again
heal slowly if no damage taken in x seconds
if player and bullet in x proximity, kill bullet, damage player -> can use same bullets for player too actually rather than hitscan


Wed:
POLISH
need to finish up, start and end screen, ui display for score and hp -> essentially find out how best to render text to screen
think might need to try and add more prominent physics thing, go back to friction with movement maybe
sort out document and video to go with the game submission

If there is time - can play with getting wall fading to sync up with floors and ceilings.






Collisions, maybe pass closest wall, calculate next locations for player movement if any old nad new points together would go through the wall then disallow the movement
Work in seperated dirs tho, so if walking to wall at angle you can move along it?

only issue could be corners with this method as we only consider one wall at once












delete the closest wall dead code
Can then work on floor ceiling stuff and collisions

change editor so deleting walls works better, sectors too would be nice
try and fix wrong rendering order for walls
also need to fix walls going down not up?

When sorting license -> need to check how to properly include dependency and tutorial.
