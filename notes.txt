TODO PLAN:
- pathing just if enemy has line of sight on player move toward them up to a certain dist -> all the way for type 2, x units for type 1

- enemy shooting adn melee on player

- let enemies spawn periodically at set points -> reduces spawn timer as the game goes on

- heal slowly if no damage taken in x seconds

- hit marker and or crosshair for aim

- start and end screen, ui display for score and hp -> essentially find out how best to render text to screen

- POLISH, do some comments and general clean up of the code

- add more prominent physics thing if there is time, go back to friction with movement maybe

MUST DO - sort out document and video to go with the game submission

also remember declaration for jetbrains single line code complete NOT CODE GEN














Not assignment related:
change editor so deleting walls works better, sectors too would be nice
When sorting license -> need to check how to properly include dependency and tutorial.
