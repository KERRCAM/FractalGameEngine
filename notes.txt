When sorting license -> need to check how to properly include dependency and tutorial.

1 - level editor
2 - sprite rendering
3 - collision detection
4 - bsp implementation
5 - recursive room rendering and traversal?
6 - perspective changing?, would just need to change between different rendering functions?, would need a character model though
7 - probably easier to do dungeon crawl esk rather than puzzle, can skip a few of previous if needed



Movement
Controls will need serious change, swap look to mouse if possible
sprint
dash, give i-frames
crouch, reduce speed and enemy detection



Could add flow field visual if 2D perspective works
