TODO PLAN:
put look controls on mouse movement

Sat: sort out player controller, dash, jump etc -> mouse controls too maybe for looking? ---------------------------- CHECK ----------------------------
Sun: Collision detection ---------------------------- CHECK ish ----------------------------
Mon: Enemy rendering and pathfinding to the player if possible -> just need to write A* in c and work with our walls
Tue: damaging enemies and enemies damaging player, score for killing enemies, game end on death etc
Wed: need to finish up, start and end screen, ui display for score and hp -> essentially find out how best to render text to screen
Wed night crunch: sort out document and video to go with the game submission

If there is time - can play with getting wall fading to sync up with floors and ceilings.






Collisions, maybe pass closest wall, calculate next locations for player movement if any old nad new points together would go through the wall then disallow the movement
Work in seperated dirs tho, so if walking to wall at angle you can move along it?

only issue could be corners with this method as we only consider one wall at once












delete the closest wall dead code
Can then work on floor ceiling stuff and collisions

change editor so deleting walls works better, sectors too would be nice
try and fix wrong rendering order for walls
also need to fix walls going down not up?

When sorting license -> need to check how to properly include dependency and tutorial.
