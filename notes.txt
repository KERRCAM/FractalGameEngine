draw file now converted to my struct types
now need to change it to pull the data from my level file format
will need a new average distance to sector function for this to replace the ws we? maybe, look into more
Once working, can then make the write to file stuff, just need some defaults, so I can not draw null walls and sectors
(don't bother checking walls in a sector if the sector itself is null)
Can then work on the reading part as well so we can actually save files fully -> i.e. load existing level information into the editor on start up

Can then work on floor ceiling stuff and collisions on Monday



add sector and level init checks at file write time -> just if sector contains any init walls then init sector and if level contains any init sectors then init level













When sorting license -> need to check how to properly include dependency and tutorial.

1 - level editor
2 - sprite rendering
3 - collision detection
4 - bsp implementation
5 - recursive room rendering and traversal?
6 - perspective changing?, would just need to change between different rendering functions?, would need a character model though
7 - probably easier to do dungeon crawl esk rather than puzzle, can skip a few of previous if needed



Movement
Controls will need serious change, swap look to mouse if possible
sprint
dash, give i-frames
crouch, reduce speed and enemy detection



Could add flow field visual if 2D perspective works
