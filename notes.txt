TODO PLAN:
put look controls on mouse movement

Sat: sort out player controller, dash, jump etc -> mouse controls too maybe for looking?
Sun: Collision detection
Mon: Enemy rendering
Tue: damaging enemies and enemies damaging player, score for killing enemies, game end on death etc
Wed: need to finish up, start and end screen, ui display for score and hp -> essentially find out how best to render text to screen
Wed night crunch: sort out document and video to go with the game submission





















delete the closest wall dead code
Can then work on floor ceiling stuff and collisions

change editor so deleting walls works better, sectors too would be nice
try and fix wrong rendering order for walls
also need to fix walls going down not up?

When sorting license -> need to check how to properly include dependency and tutorial.
