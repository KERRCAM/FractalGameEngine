GAME:
... TBD



delete the closest wall dead code
Can then work on floor ceiling stuff and collisions

change editor so deleting walls works better, sectors too would be nice
try and fix wrong rendering order for walls
also need to fix walls going down not up?

When sorting license -> need to check how to properly include dependency and tutorial.
