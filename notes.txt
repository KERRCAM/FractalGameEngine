TODO PLAN:
- add more prominent physics thing if there is time, go back to friction with movement maybe

MUST DO - sort out document and video to go with the game submission

also remember declaration for jetbrains single line code complete NOT CODE GEN














Not assignment related:
change editor so deleting walls works better, sectors too would be nice
When sorting license -> need to check how to properly include dependency and tutorial.
